/**
 * Gather every account's quota for the pool-wide status line.
 *
 * The single-account status the request path maintains cannot answer "where
 * does the pool stand" - it only ever describes the account that served the
 * last response. This reads `/wham/usage` for each distinct account instead,
 * on a bounded interval, and caches the result where every OpenCode window on
 * the machine can share it.
 *
 * The cache is what keeps this cheap. A reader takes a snapshot that is still
 * fresh rather than issuing its own requests, so N terminals open on the same
 * pool cost one round of requests between them rather than N, and a terminal
 * that has just started renders immediately instead of showing nothing while
 * seven accounts are queried one after another.
