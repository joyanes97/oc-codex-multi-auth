/**
 * One constant line describing the whole account pool.
 *
 * The prompt status line names whichever account served the most recent
 * request, so on a pool of several accounts it changes identity as rotation
 * moves - and a reader who wants to know where the pool stands has to watch it
 * long enough to see every account go past. This module renders the pool
 * instead: every account at once, in a fixed order, so the line only changes
 * when the underlying quota does.
 *
 * ```text
 * 24%: #1 5x 13%, #2 20x 100% 3d 1r, #3 1x 12%
 * ```
 *
 * The leading figure is the pool total, and it is a WEIGHTED mean rather than
 * a plain one. A Pro seat spent to 50% has given up twenty times the capacity
 * a Business Standard seat does at 50%, so averaging the percentages
 * unweighted describes a pool nobody has; `lib/plan-allotment.ts` supplies the
 * per-plan ratio the mean is taken over.
 *
 * Percentages follow `quotaDisplay` like every other surface, so the same pool
 * reads `24%` as headroom or `76%` as consumption. Only the wording changes:
 * every decision here - which window governs an account, which account is
 * closest to recovering, whether a reset time is worth the characters - stays
 * keyed on the percentage remaining.
 *
 * Everything below is pure string work over already-gathered readings, so the
 * whole rendering can be exercised without a network, a clock or a terminal.
